			<h3>Introduction to the Stones</h3>
		
			<p>Before we delve into training the stones, there are a few things that it’s important to understand about them. Stones are a unique event in the Highland Games. Every other event involves accelerating and building momentum in an implement that is held at beyond arm's length (because we’re throwing the weight of the implement, not the handle or fork) by pushing that implement ahead of the hip. In the stones, you are not building momentum in the implement through the approach. The goal is to develop a stretch reflex at the front, and use that to rapidly produce momentum at the finish. You are not holding the implement beyond arm's length, you are keeping it as close to the body as possible. You are not pushing it ahead of your hips, you’re leaving it as far behind them as possible to achieve that stretch. These are all complete opposites to every other unilateral event (everything that’s not WOB or Caber) in the Highland Games.</p>
			<p>Because of this, we have to approach training them very differently to the other throws. However, these differences also allow us the opportunity to break the throw down a LOT more than you are able to in the other throws. Specifically the facts that the implement is held close to the center of mass, and we are not attempting to build momentum in the approach, but rather a stretch reflex. Because of this, we are able to fractionate the throw much more. There is no way you could break the stand throw of the weight for distance into 5 progressive throws. Weights require the momentum to build through the throw, which keeps the weight in its orbit. Stones don’t require this, and because of this we’re able to fractionate the throw down to every single individual movement. For that reason, there will be a lot more “drill” throws in the stones, leading up to your full throw.</p>
			<p>When training any event, but especially the stones, I really like working from the front to the back. You could have the world’s best approach but if your finish is subpar, your throw will be subpar. Conversely, if you have a subpar approach but an incredible finish, it will still turn out to be a pretty good throw. Maybe not as good as a throw with an excellent approach AND finish, but certainly better than any throw with a poor finish.</p>
			<p>That being said, each step of this progression is aimed at adding one step backward from the very front of the throw. If we think of this in terms of the throw developing from the ground up, this also means that in the reverse direction, we will be working from release down to the ground. Starting with the Kneeling Throw, which is entirely focused on the upper body finishing the throw.</p>
			<p>However, before we even get that far, we need to understand how the upper body block and strike are done correctly. This is how they should be done in every one of these progressions. And while we’re discussing somewhat miscellaneous ideas that will apply to all of these progressions we’ll talk about the reverse, and the idea of staying stacked as well.</p>

			<h3>The Strike</h3>
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"> <!-- this div for figure 1.1 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.1: The ball of the hand. Where the center of balance of the stone should settle.</p>
				</div>
			Before we get to the strike, let's talk about properly tucking the stone to facilitate a good release and flick on the stone. The stone should sit in the ball of your hand. Much like your foot has a ball, your hand also has a ball. The ball of your hand is the pads where your fingers meet your palm.</p>	
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.2 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.2: Here the athlete can be seen with the shot held in the proper tuck. Also squinting into the sun… And maybe needing a good shave and haircut…</p>
				</div>
			The center of mass on the stone should sit right here. This will put a large portion of the stone in your fingertips, and the palm of your hand will not touch the stone. With the stone settled into that position on your hand, the other side of the stone is “tucked” into the neck. That is, for most throwers, a couple inches below and slightly behind the jaw bone. This may move depending on a few things (scapular mobility, upper arm compared to lower arm lengths, sometimes even glide vs spin) but the main concern is A) your elbow is behind the stone and B) it's not terribly uncomfortable.</p>

			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.3 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_3" src="https://i.imgur.com/PuYG2Wy.jpg" alt="Proper Strike">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.3: In the above figure, the athlete can be seen finishing the strike through the shot put. Notice the head, shoulders and chest position. Up and looking at the ball as it leaves the fingertips. This is ideal.</p>
				</div>
			The strike is done with the dominant hand. It is the point of the throw when the stone leaves the tucked position and is propelled forward by the striking arm (dominant arm.) The strike ends with the stone leaving the hand by “flicking” it off the fingertips.</p>
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.4 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_4" src="https://i.imgur.com/ejP1sxw.jpg" alt="Block then strike demo">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.4: In this kneeling throw, you can see two important things. First, the left blocking arm has nearly completed the block before the right arm has begun the strike. Second, the elbow is directly behind the shot, which enables the athlete to strike through the ball.</p>
				</div>
			It’s important to keep in mind that it is ideal to keep the elbow directly behind the stone so that you are pushing through the stone, not working the stone around the axis point that is your elbow. This is why it’s important to keep the elbow up, as it is unlikely that you will be driving through the stone at the appropriate angle from a dropped elbow position.<br><br>The strike is always done immediately following the block. You cannot strike and then block. The block must come first. This sequence happens incredibly quickly, but it is tremendously important to maintain that sequence.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="contents"  id="theBlock"> <!-- This is The Block block-->
			<h3>The Block</h3>
			
			<p>The block from the arm (there is a lower body block as well, but let's focus on the upper body first) essentially means to pull the blocking (non dominant) elbow down aggressively (without turning to the blocking side or dropping the blocking shoulder) towards the blocking side lat. It is incredibly important to understand that this does not mean turn left. It is critical that your head, chest and shoulders remain squared up with the front and continue to lift up and out. If you turn away from the throw, you are pulling away from it and taking away your ability to drive forward into the finish.</p>
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.5 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_5" src="https://i.imgur.com/WoSnsvY.jpg" alt="Elevating blocking side">
					<p class="figure-desc">"Figure 1.5: In the above figure, the athlete can be seen with the blocking arm having blocked, with the blocking side still elevated. It is critical that the shoulders remain squared up and elevating through the entire finish of the throw.</p>
				</div>
			Keep your head position squared up, keep your chest lifting up and out, and bring the blocking elbow down to your lat hard. This needs to be violently aggressive. Blocking is your stopping power. The more stopping power you have, the more aggressively you can afford to strike without fouling over the toe board. A bigger block means a bigger strike. Not the other way around.</p>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="contents"  id="theReverse"> <!-- This is The Reverse block-->
			<h3>The Reverse</h3>
			
			<p>The reverse is often mistaken as an action at the end of the throw. Something that you complete the finish with. This is not the case. It is a reaction. A by product of the throw. If you are actively making yourself reverse, rather than reversing as a means to prevent yourself from fouling over the front after a big finish, you are doing it wrong.<br><br>So how do we reverse correctly? Well first we have to understand exactly what I mean by it being a reaction or a means to prevent a foul. In your stone throws, you will deliver the stone into sector via a combination of actions that boil down to a driving dominant leg, a striking dominant arm and a blocking non dominant side. With all of this, the goal is to deliver every bit of momentum that your body can produce into the implement. If this happens perfectly, every bit of that momentum is transferred into the implement and has therefore left your body, meaning your body stops. This is what happens in a “no reverse” throw.<br><br>In a reverse, the athlete produces more force than they are able to transfer into the implement, leaving residual momentum in the body that has to be “caught” with a reverse, else the athlete will continue to move forward and foul over the toe board. This is not an inherently bad thing. While some momentum never quite makes it into the implement, it is still typically more than would have made it into the implement in a no reverse throw.<br><br>To give an arbitrary example, let's say in a no reverse throw you are able to produce 80 watts of power. In the same throw with a reverse, you are able to produce 100 watts of power, but are only able to transfer 90% of that into the implement. Sure, you’re losing 10% to residual losses, but you’re still producing 90 functional watts, or 10 more than in the no reverse. Now of course, these are just numbers I’ve pulled off the top of my head and wouldn’t be accurate at all, but the point is, a throw with a reverse will generally produce more functional power than a no reverse throw PROVIDED you develop the proper efficiency. That means that in our model, if you lose 25% to residual momentum that never made it into the implement, you are losing functional power in the throw by reversing with poor efficiency.</p>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.7: As the athlete completes the strike he will come off the ground. The athlete “catches” himself on his driving leg while extending the blocking leg back to counter his weight back into the trig.</p>
				</div>
			So, how do you properly reverse? I mentioned that an athlete would have to “catch” themselves with a reverse, else continue to move forward and foul the throw. By this I mean to literally catch yourself on your driving leg. The driving leg will (in a throw with a reverse) leave the ground as the body lifts up and out over the blocking leg. As this happens, the driving leg is brought under the center of mass and comes to the ground again at the toe board. The blocking leg will do the opposite, coming off the ground and extending back to where the driving leg was before the reverse. Simply put, the feet switch places.<br><br>That being said, I will reiterate that this is a REACTION to residual momentum propelling the athlete forward, not a forced action. You should be trying to stay on the ground, as in a no reverse, and only reversing as the driving leg comes off the ground of its own accord due to producing more power than the athlete is able to transfer into the implement. A forced reverse will more often than not result in coming off the ground too early, which immediately removes your ability to produce force. All force is built from the ground up. Any amount of time you are not in contact with the ground, even a split second to early, means lost power. Remember, REACTION, not action.<br><br>One last note about the reverse. This is absolutely not something you have to strive to master or even complete early on. In fact, it is generally a good practice to remove the reverse if things are going wrong and you aren’t sure why. To complete a no reverse, your body must be well aligned at the front. Alignment is never a bad thing to spend more time on. For that reason, I recommend every one of these progressions as well as 100% of the full throws you take up until a few weeks to a month out from your first competition of the season to be no reverse throws. Once you add the reverse, it should be a gradual shift into reversing more frequently in your training. Start with just the last few throws being reversed, and every practice make it a higher percentage of your throws that have a reverse. And absolutely don’t be afraid to backtrack to the no reverse! If the reverse is fouling you up, remember, it's not necessary to throw big!</p>

			<h3>Staying Stacked</h3>
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.8 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_8" src="https://i.imgur.com/zRMaQf6.jpg" alt="stacked spine">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.8: In the above figure, we can see the athlete in a stacked position.The athlete has his shoulders, hips and driving foot, all more or less on top of each other. We can see with the tool that his spine is roughly 15 degrees off from vertical. Perfectly stacked will not happen, but based on levers and mobility, one can expect to get somewhere around this close plus or minus a few degrees.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.9 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_9" src="https://i.imgur.com/pkYRrHp.jpg" alt="Unstacked spine">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.9: In this figure, we see the athlete very much not stacked. The shoulders are out past the foot, the hips are far behind the foot, and the spine can be seen to be roughly 63 degrees off from vertical. While this is not always bad (as is the case in this position, which we will discuss when we get to the Braemar Stone) it is generally advisable to strive for more stacked than this, unless otherwise instructed.</p>
				</div>
			The idea of staying stacked is very simple. It essentially means to keep every vertebrae in the spinal column directly on top of the one below it, keeping your hips under your upper body, and keeping your feet under your hips. The goal here is to keep the upper body as upright, and the center of mass as balanced over the feet as possible.<br><br>While perfectly upright is an unrealistic goal, the imagery is what will keep you in the most appropriate positioning. This will accomplish a few things.<br><br>First, it will prevent leaning and balance issues. A lot of throwers have a tendency to lead with their shoulders in any given movement. This ends with them leaning, and will move their center of balance away from over their feet. This ends with the athlete falling into positions instead of driving into them, and will almost certainly end with poor alignment at the front of the throw.<br><br>The second big issue with allowing the spine to flex, or unstack, is that you’ve effectively turned your spine into a shock absorber by flexing the spine. With vertebrae stacked on top of each other, the only give that you get when transfering force directly up through the spine is the cushion of the discs between vertebrae. In a flexed spine, you get all the give that every muscle trying to keep your spine erect will undoubtedly allow (iI don’t care how strong you think your back is, this will happen) with the sudden production of force being delivered up through the spinal column. With force coming from the ground up, it is imperative that we don’t allow any part of the kinetic chain to become a shock absorber.<br><br>These are the two big reasons that it is important to keep the spine stacked at all costs. Don’t let the spine flex to achieve more separation. Don’t let the spine flex to artificially lengthen levers. Just don’t let the spine flex. It is often appropriate to extend the spine slightly, this will happen as you drive your hips forward in all throws, but never to flex the spine.<br><br>Now that I’ve said that, there will be a select few exceptions to this rule. But unless specifically instructed otherwise, assume this is the rule to live and die by in all throws!<br><br>One last thing to mention regarding stacking the spine. A very easy way to keep the spine stacked is to keep your head position. Your body will follow your head. If you drop your head, your spine will flex. If you look up, your spine will extend. If you keep your head and eyes looking just slightly up, you will find yourself in a neutral spine position, with the vertebrae stacked the way we want them. The cue I have often used for myself and athletes I have trained is to point straight out, not up or down, with the chin.</p>

			<h3>The Kneeling Throw</h3>

				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.10 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.10: Here the athlete can be seen in the starting position of the Kneeling Throw.</p>
				</div>
			The Kneeling Throw is done to entirely remove the lower body, and focus entirely on the upper body block and strike. Kneeling on the ground with both knees at the toe board, the athlete will tuck the stone just under and behind the jaw bone with the dominant arm and extend the blocking arm (non dominant) out toward the sector.</p>
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.11 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.11: Here we can see the athlete having blocked with the blocking arm, and finishing the throw with a strike through the ball.</p>
				</div>
			From here, the athlete will “block” with the blocking arm, which is to pull the elbow toward the blocking side lat aggressively <strong>(without turning the body or head to that side.)</strong> While the blocking arm blocks, the striking arm will strike through the stone and release it into sector.</p>
		</div>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.12: Here, the athlete can be seen in the Toe-to-board starting position.</p>
				</div>
			The idea of the Toe-to-board throw is to put together the upper body strike and block with a connection to the ground. The athlete starts with the stone tucked, the blocking arm reached out over the toe board into the sector and both feet’s toes up against the toe board.</p>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.13: Here, the athlete can be seen in the Toe-to-board loaded position.</p>

			Without turning, the athlete bows back, slightly bending the knees and pushing the hips forward creating a slightly extended posterior chain. This is the loaded position.</P>
			
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.14 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.14: Here, the athlete can be seen extending the posterior chain and striking through the ball.</p>
				</div>
			From here, the athlete “blocks” with the blocking arm, pulling the elbow down aggressively <strong>(without turning to the blocking side)</strong> towards the blocking side lat. While this happens, the right arm extends and “strikes” through the stone to deliver it into the sector. The slight extension in the posterior chain will flex toward neutral, however it is important to not allow the athlete to flex beyond neutral. In doing this, the athlete’s chest will lift up and out. This is what we want. More or less, just avoid letting the athlete’s butt stick out backward. Focus on getting as tall at the front of the throw as you can.<br><br>Upon release of the stone, you will find that your body will fall forward and over the toe board. Even though we are taught to never foul a throw, this is what you want. In the Toe-to-board throw your feet are both up against the toe board, which means you don’t have a blocking and driving leg. Because of this, you really don’t have any stopping power, and cannot be expected to drive forward into the stone while remaining behind the toe board after release. Expect to step over the toe board.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="contents"  id="frontFacingStand">		<!-- This is the Front Facing Stand block-->
			<h3>Front Facing Stand Throws</h3>
			
			<p>The Front Facing Stand throw is the next step back, and simply put, that’s all it is. A step back. Find your Toe-to-board starting position, and with the dominant foot step back. Leave the non dominant foot at the front of the trig, up against the toe board. Like in the Toe-to-board throw, your blocking arm is extended out over the toe board “reaching” toward sector. The striking arm has the stone tucked, ready to strike.</p>
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.15 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_15" src="https://i.imgur.com/WQs9ZXr.jpg" alt="reverce C position">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.15: In the above figure, the athlete can be seen in the “Reverse C” position.</p>
				</div>
			From here, the athlete will rock their weight back to the right foot on a slightly bent right leg and slightly extend the posterior chain, once again without turning to the left. This position is the “reverse C” position that you often hear about. From a side view, you will see the body making a “C” shape with the head and shoulders back, the hips forward, and the driving leg back. This should be a slight stretch, but not so much that it is uncomfortable.</p>
			
			<p id="finish-execution">From this position, a few things will happen more or less simultaneously. The blocking arm and leg will block together while the dominant leg drives through the ground to propel the hips and subsequently the upper body forward. These three things initiate the strike with the striking arm, which should start immediately after the other three start. So let's break each of these down again.<br><br>Blocking Arm: This arm will break at the elbow and pull down towards your lat. Pull the elbow down while the upper body continues to elevate through the finish of the throw. Elbow yourself in the lat as your chest rises towards the finish. Refer to <em><a href="#figure1_5">Figure 1.5</a></em> for a visual of what this should look like.<br><br>Blocking Leg: This is a new addition in this progression. The non dominant leg will stomp the ground at the front of the trig aggressively. Think of punching a hole in the ground with the foot. In doing so, your ankle, knee and hip will extend and as your body is propelled forward (by the driving leg.)This becomes your stopping power. The goal is to get the chest as “tall” over the non dominant leg as you can.</p>
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.16 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_16" src="https://i.imgur.com/9CNqjda.jpg" alt="Blocking and driving leg working together.">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.16: In the above figure, you can see how the driving leg pushes forward while the blocking leg lifts the athlete straight up. This is what’s called “climbing the block” and can be identified by the upper body being directly over the blockin leg, getting as tall as possible.</p>
				</div>	
			Driving Leg: This leg is the driving force behind the finish. Similar to how the blocking leg extends at the hip, knee and ankle, the driving leg does so as well. It however drives forward instead of up. Between the forward driving momentum of the driving leg and the upward momentum of the blocking leg, we get a combined momentum that drives the hips and upper body up and out hopefully around a 45 degree angle, which is ideal.<br><br>Strike arm: This arm strikes forward, propelling the stone forward and up in the same direction that our hips and upper body are propelled by the driving and blocking legs. I will note again that the idea is to strike through the stone, not to work the stone around the elbow axis. Remember, keep the elbow up and behind the stone. <em>Refer to <a href="#figure1_3">Figure 1.3</a> for a visual of what this should look like.</em></p>

			<h3>Turn Back Stand Throws</h3>
			
			<p>The Turn Back Stand starts in the same position as the Front Facing Stand. Blocking leg at the front of the trig up against the toe board, driving leg back one step from the toe board, strike arm holding the stone tucked and ready to fire, and the blocking arm extended out toward sector.</p>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.17: Here we can see the athlete in the loaded position of the Turn Back Stand throw. Notice, the athlete’s feet, knees and hips are pointing forward. The upper body has turned away from the throw as much as possible without collapsing in the trunk and losing the stack. This is key, as it is very easy to let the spine flex to release the rotational tension and turn a little further.</p>
				</div>
				
			From here, the athlete will rock back and load up onto the driving leg. Just like in the Front Facing Stand, you will create the reverse C position by rocking back onto a bent driving leg with your hips forward and your shoulders and head up and extended back. This is where the differences begin. With the feet, knees and hips still pointing forward, you will turn the upper body toward the dominant or driving side. This is where it is imperative to keep the spine stacked! The spine will want to flex to allow for more rotation. Don’t let this happen! Keep stacked! Your blocking arm will sweep backward wide, reaching back toward the back of the trig. Depending on the athletes mobility, they may be able to reach back only half way before they feel a stretch and their feet start turning, or they may be able to get all the way turned around without letting the feet turn. The goal is to reach back as far as the athlete can to establish that stretch between the lower and upper body.<br><br>This is the loaded position for the Turn Back Stand and the point at which we start the throw. Without hesitation, when the athlete finds that stretch, the throw needs to begin. This doesn’t mean crank back around (although as an athlete develops this skill, they will be able to be more aggressive) this can be done slowly to learn the movement. But it does need to begin without hesitation.</p>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.18: Here, the athlete can be seen opening the left blocking arm towards the throw. As the blocking arm is swept wide, the head chest and shoulders begin to be pulled around to face the finish.</p>
				</div>
				
			From here, the blocking arm sweeps wide back to the extended out into sector position. The athlete’s head and shoulders should remain facing back as long as they can while the blocking arm sweeps wide. As the blocking arm sweeps wide, the upper body will inevitably begin to turn towards the front again, but the athlete must make an effort to keep the head, chest and shoulders back for as long as possible. For less mobile athletes, this will be very challenging.<br><br>Once the blocking arm has reached out over the toe board, reaching into sector, the athlete will more or less be in the Front Facing Stand position (albeit with the chest, shoulders and head loaded further back by being turned toward the dominant side) and will execute the front facing stand the same way.<br><br>Block with the blocking arm and leg, drive forward with the driving leg. As the athlete climbs the block, the upper body will come around to square up to sector and the athlete and strike through the stone. For a refresher on how all this is executed, refer to the instruction on the <a href="#finish-execution">Front Facing Stand</a>.</p>

			<h3>The Stand Throw</h3>
			
			<p>In an effort to keep consistent and continue to work backward, instead of starting at the rear, I’m going to teach the stand throw starting from the Front Facing Stand. The point of this is for the athlete to understand that this is a progression, and one will lead into the other. All the positions the athlete has hit in the previous progressions need to continue to be hit as they move further back in the throw, and they should be hit in the same sequence that we are adding them to the back.<br><br>That being said, let's start with the Front Facing Stand position. Blocking leg at the front of the trig, driving leg on step back from the front. Blocking arm extended out into the sector, chest shoulders and head squared up and facing the front, striking arm loaded with the stone tucked.</p>

					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.19: Here, the athlete can be seen in the starting position of the stand throw. The head, chest and shoulders wrapped back as far as mobility allows, the blocking arm wrapped back with them, the spine relatively stacked, and the weight over the driving leg.</p>
				</div>
				
			From here, the athlete will proceed backward into the Turn Back Stand. Sweeping the blocking arm wide as the upper body turns toward the driving side of the body and stretches to look backward. Once that familiar stretch is achieved between the upper and lower body and the feet begin to try to turn back, the athlete will allow them to turn. Continue to turn back, even letting the lower body turn back with the upper body to the point that the athlete is able to face 180 degrees turned away from the center sector. This is the starting position for the Stand Throw.</p>

				</div>
				
			From here, the athlete will work back through the sequence they did to find this position in reverse. First, the lower body and the blocking arm (but not the rest of the upper body) will start to turn and open towards the front. The driving hip, knee and toe will all turn toward sector, and the blocking arm will swing wide with the head and shoulders remaining back.<br><br>This will create that familiar stretch between the upper and lower body, and will start to “pull” the upper body around. At this point, the athlete will have achieved the loaded position of the Front Facing Stand throw. That is, the lower body facing sector, and the upper body turned back as far as the mobility of the athlete will allow.<br><br>At this point, the athlete will proceed to execute the rest of the throw as they did in the Turn Back Stand throw. Sweep the blocking arm wide to reach out into sector. With the head, chest and shoulders still turned back as much as possible, the athlete will begin to block with the blocking arm and leg, and drive forward with the driving leg at the same time. As the athlete “climbs” the block, the upper body will come around to square up to sector and the athlete will strike through the stone to deliver it into sector.</p>

			<h3>Braemar Stone</h3>
			
			<p>Here’s the part where you say “Wait a minute! The Braemar Stone IS the stand throw! We’ve already covered this!” And to that I would say “You have been misled!”<br><br>The Stand Throw is a drill that we execute as a position we will find ourselves in in the open stone. The Braemar Stone is a competition throw that we need to take every advantage we can in. This includes creating an artificial approach by making the stand as long as possible so that we have the longest time to build force.</p>
			<p>
				<div class="figures"><!-- this div for figure 1.21 is nested inside the paragraph to make the text wrap around both the image and the subtext. -->
					<img class="demo-pics" id="figure1_21" src="https://i.imgur.com/yKsQiST.jpg" alt="Braemar Stone starting position">
					<p class="figure-desc">Figure 1.21: Here we can see the athlete in a Braemar Stone starting position. Compare this to <a href="#figure1_19">Figure 1.19</a> and consider the difference in the distance the athlete has to push on the implement. A longer distance to push means more time to build force. Another consideration is that the athlete is able to load this driving leg quite a bit more in this position. Similar to a longer push with the upper body, a longer drive with that leg will mean more time to build force.</p>
				</div>
			So what’s the difference? Well, if you refer to <em><a href="#figure1_8">Figure 1.8</a> and <a href="#figure1_9">Figure 1.9</a></em> you will recall that I mentioned there are instances when it will be appropriate to allow yourself to become unstacked. This is one of those cases.<br><br>So what adjustments do we make to achieve this position? There are a couple simple changes to be made to the stand to find the position displayed in <em>Figure 1.21.</em></br>First, we have to take a wider stance. The driving leg will step back a bit further in the Braemar Stone, which accomplishes a couple things. A) it gives us a longer drive forward (refer to <em><a href="#figure1_16">Figure 1.16</a></em>) off of the driving leg. And B) it gives us the ability to drive our shoulder further toward the rear of the trig without losing our balance and falling backward. Which brings us to the second adjustment.<br><br>Two, we drive our shoulders toward the rear of the trig and drop our whole body lower on that driving right leg. This is where we create the most length possible. From this position we have likely doubled the length of the push that we had in the Stand Throw.<br><br>Otherwise, it is executed the exact same way as the Stand Throw! Which is convenient, as there isn’t too much more to learn. But keep in mind, these adjustments will create some new challenges with balance and timing. Don’t rush through this and start trying to bomb PRs right away. Take it slow and become comfortable with these adjustments and slowly ramp up the intensity, and it won’t be long at all before you’re throwing PRs at your next competition!</p>
